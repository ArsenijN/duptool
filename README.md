# duptool
Advanced way to compare things

## Why duptool exists?
I recently have to do comparison between folders and only between (like from folder1 in folder2), but Total Commander doesn't have compare feature with that behaviour, so comparing process takes long time for me

So, duptool allows to compare files from 1st folder in 2nd folder by "-B" argument (bidirectional mode) and not compare files from 1st in 1st and 2nd in 2nd. Also, duptool have fast compare feature with "-C" that allow to pre-process files before full compare by comparing only first and last 8 MB
